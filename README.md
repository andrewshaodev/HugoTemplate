# HugoTemplate
Template for Creating a Containerized Hugo Dev Environment.

This is mainly based off of [Microsoft VSCode Dev Container for Hugo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/hugo)

A bash script was added at the root directory to find the codespace url and allows it to be the baseURL. 

Running it in place of hugo server will allow you to see the links and assets that would normally be on
localhost:1313 by default.

In terminal, run the command ./runshugoerver.sh
